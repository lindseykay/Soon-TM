- Worked as a team of 4 on the following:
    - Built a working boilerplate yaml file for database and services to test fast API endpoints
    - Created working endpoints with fast API for creating a new user account and retrieving a single user account
- Looking forwards:
    - Finish user endpoints by adding in an endpoint for updating
    - Divide into initial pairs and assign tasks for completing out backend
